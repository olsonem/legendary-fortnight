# The Lake Isle Of Innisfree
     
  #### By William Butler Yeats



I will **arise** and go now, and go to *Innisfree,*

And a [small cabin](http://housedesignideas.us/free-small-cabin-floor-plans/) build there, of clay and wattles made:

Nine bean-rows will I have there, a [hive for the honeybee,](https://jardindesigndotorg1.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dsc02062.jpg)

And live alone in the bee-loud glade.

*And I shall have some peace there,* for peace comes dropping slow,

Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;

There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a <font color=purple>purple</font> glow,

And evening full of the linnet's wings.

**I will _arise_ and go now,** for always night and day

I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;

While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,

I hear it in the deep heart's core.
